# OdinProject
Collection of my work while using the Odin Project. 

This will just be me working on all the projects and also all 
the work completed while working on the lessons. I will also 
use this as a way to practice working with git and GitHub.

first-project:

This project is just a culmination of a bunch of the different HTML 
knowledge that was gained within the first few lessons on the website.
It includes relative links, images, headers, paragraphs, strong and 
emphasized text.

git-recipes:

A page that has mutliple links to a couple of different absolute 
references. Once I have completed this I will have further understood
the formatting of HTML webpages and how to change attributes. Will also 
give a better feel for creating and using HTML elements.
